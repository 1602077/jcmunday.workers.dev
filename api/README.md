## wasm

`workers-rs` (the Rust SDK for Cloudflare Workers used in this template) is meant to be executed as 
compiled WebAssembly, and as such so **must** all the code you write and depend upon. All crates and
modules used in Rust-based Workers projects have to compile to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` triple. 

Read more about this on the [`workers-rs` project README](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs).
